<a href="#intention" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="intention"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Intention</h2><p>Intent refers to the meaning of user input. We believe that the user’s input implies a certain meaning, and assign this kind of statements containing the same meaning with an intention tag.</p><h3 id="example"> <a href="#example" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="example"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Example</h3><p>In order to support multiple user inputs and reduce the possibility of robot answering incorrectly, multiple example sentences are supported for each intention. Example sentences will be used as training samples and put into the intention classification model for training. Therefore, the number and quality of example sentences determine the accuracy of robot replies to a large extent. In the editing of examples, we hope that the distinction between different intentions is as high as possible, that is, examples with different intentions should not overlap as much as possible; At the same time, the expression of example sentences in similar intentions can be as rich as possible, for example:</p><ul><li>Intention 1: Greet<ul><li>Hello!<li>Hello.</ul><li>Intention 2: Goodbye<ul><li>See you tomorrow.<li>Bye From the perspective of model training, the generalization ability of Intent 1 is weaker than that of Intent 2. Therefore, if you can provide more and more unique examples, the effect of the model will be better.</ul></ul><h3 id="intention-list"> <a href="#intention-list" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="intention-list"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Intention List</h3><p>The intention list exists for the purpose of reusing intention. We often encounter repeated intentions in the dialogue, such as confirmation, denial and thanks. This kind of intention often appears in different positions of the dialogue process, while repeatedly constructing repeated intentions is tedious and error prone. The concept of intention list is to solve this problem. We can save the intention to be reused as an intention template and add it to the intention list. When we need to use this intention elsewhere in the project, we can directly reference the saved intention. Another advantage of this design is that we only need to operate once when we need to add, modify, or delete samples in a certain intention.</p><p>We strongly recommend that you use the intention list as much as possible. On the one hand, the reuse of intention can make the design easier; On the other hand, the combination of similar intentions can greatly improve the recognition accuracy of the model.</p><h3 id="assurance-of-accuracy-of-intent-classification"> <a href="#assurance-of-accuracy-of-intent-classification" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="assurance-of-accuracy-of-intent-classification"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Assurance of accuracy of intent classification</h3><p>Due to the diversity of languages, more data are often required for model training to obtain better recognition performance. As the generalization ability of the machine increases with the increase of data, if you find that the recognition accuracy of the intention is not high enough, please confirm in turn:</p><ol><li>Whether there are similar unconsolidated intentions. If yes, please merge the intention and save it in the intention list for reuse.<li>Whether there are too few examples in the intention. If the number of examples with different intentions is less than 3, or the number of examples with different intentions is unbalanced, please add more examples as appropriate.<li>Whether the sample used for testing exists in two or more intentions. If it exists, please reorganize your intentions. If possible, please do not put the same sample into more different intentions, which will confuse the model.</ol><h2 id="answer"> <a href="#answer" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="answer"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Answer</h2><p>The answer refers to the bot’s reply. The system will reply different information according to different input of users.</p><p>The answer supports three forms:</p><ol><li>Text<li>Image<li>Webhook The answer must include a text message.</ol><h3 id="answer-list"> <a href="#answer-list" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="answer-list"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Answer List</h3><p>The answer list exists for the reuse of answers. We often encounter repeated answers in conversations, such as goodbye, calling the same webhook, and thanks. Such answers often appear in different positions of the dialogue process, and it is tedious and error prone to repeatedly construct repeated answers. The concept of answer list is to solve this problem. We can save the answer to be reused as an answer template and add it to the answer list. When we need to use this answer elsewhere in the project, we can directly reference the saved answer. Another advantage of this design is that when we need to add, modify, or delete an answer, we only need to operate once.</p><p>We strongly recommend that you use the answer list as much as possible. Reuse of answers can make the design easier and save a lot of time in building your flow diagram.</p><h2 id="variable"> <a href="#variable" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="variable"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Variable</h2><p>Variables are the memory of the bot. Declared variables represent what information the bot needs to remember. For example, in the scenario of booking a train ticket, the user provides the required information, such as destination, departure time, and seat requirements, during the multi round conversation with the machine. This kind of information needs to be recorded until the end of the dialogue, and then determine the final destination of these variables according to the actual situation. Without variables, the bot cannot remember any information during the conversation.</p><h3 id="extraction-of-variables"> <a href="#extraction-of-variables" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="extraction-of-variables"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Extraction of variables</h3><p>Variable extraction can occur anywhere in the conversation process. It can be extracted from user input or set manually. The following are several ways to extract variables.</p><h3 id="entity-extraction"> <a href="#entity-extraction" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="entity-extraction"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Entity extraction</h3><p>Entity extraction is the most common method in variable extraction. It is usually used to extract some information in user input, such as time, place, name, mobile number, specific information, etc. We provide built-in variables and dimension variables. Among them, built-in variables are variables that can be extracted by rules. At present, they include date, number, telephone, and ordinal words, eliminating the trouble of manual marking. Such variables will continue to be updated in subsequent releases. The labeled variables are for some special cases, such as the need to extract some specific words. Such words need to be labeled manually, predicted and extracted with the help of machine learning and models. As with example sentences, the accuracy of extraction can be improved by providing a variety of expressions and displaying different entity words in example sentences as much as possible.</p><h3 id="input-text"> <a href="#input-text" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="input-text"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Input Text</h3><p>The input text mode is usually used to extract the entire user input statement. A common application scenario is to collect user feedback and ask if there are other requirements. This type of scenario usually requires a complete record of the user’s speech, rather than extracting a specific phrase from it. It should be noted that although we do not care about the specific values extracted, we still need to add different examples to ensure that the model understands that the current user input belongs to the purpose of extraction, so as to extract variables.</p><h3 id="custom-value"> <a href="#custom-value" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="custom-value"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Custom Value</h3><p>The custom value method is similar to the input text. However, the common scenario is whether a service is required. In other words, a limited number of categories need to be filled in with this variable. For example, when booking air tickets, users may need to ask if they need a window seat. At this time, we expect the value of the variable ‘windows’ to be’ true | false ‘, and do not want to fill in other values. That is to say, no matter whether the user says “Yes” or “I want to rely on the window”, we want the ‘windows’ variable to be set to’ True ‘. Therefore, we provide a user-defined value method, which specific value can be filled according to a user’s intention. This value is mandatory and you can decide.</p><h3 id="reset-variable-values"> <a href="#reset-variable-values" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="reset-variable-values"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Reset Variable Values</h3><p>The above methods are all methods to extract variables from user input. If you need to extract variables after a bot replies, you can use reset variable values to set them. The difference between this setting method and the above three methods is:</p><ol><li>The scopes are different. The scope of this method is a specific context, that is, the reset only takes effect in the current dialog; The above methods are globally effective. If you want to extract variables specifically in multiple scenes of the conversation, use Reset Variable Values.<li>Reset the variable value to transfer the variable value. The variables with the same name are extracted by default based on the variables entered by the user. If you need to reuse some built-in variables or set some variable values to other extracted variables, you can use Reset Variable Values.</ol><h2 id="user-question-and-answer-faq"> <a href="#user-question-and-answer-faq" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="user-question-and-answer-faq"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> User question and answer (FAQ）</h2><p>User question and answer (FAQ) provides the function of one question and one answer, which simplifies the design of dialogue process. User Q&amp;A is mainly aimed at a class of questions that are not closely related to the process. It is characterized by a large number of questions. Each question has its own answer, but it has no great impact on the dialogue process. If you use the flow diagram to define, you need to edit a large number of branches. On the one hand, adding operations is cumbersome, and on the other hand, it is not easy to maintain the flow diagram. Therefore, we have designed a user question and answer function to separate the definition of such questions without affecting the overall flow diagram.</p><h2 id="form"> <a href="#form" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="form"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Form</h2><p>For multiple information collection scenarios: air ticket booking, hotel booking, order after-sales, etc., we have designed a form function. Information collection is performed by machine operation. Only a few necessary settings are needed to achieve the design of complex processes. The following is an introduction to several related concepts in form design.</p><h3 id="slots"> <a href="#slots" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="slots"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Slots</h3><p>The information list defines several variables that the form needs to collect, how the robot asks about these variables, how the user answers, and how to extract variables. When there are multiple extraction methods, they can be written in turn. The robot will ask the user in sequence until all variables are collected. Note that the robot will skip the assigned variables when asking.</p><h3 id="interrupts"> <a href="#interrupts" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="interrupts"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Interrupts</h3><p>Users may not answer in the way we expect. In fact, we hope that the machine can process user input more intelligently. For example, when we are asking for some information, if the user asks “I don’t want to continue filling”, we hope to exit the form properly. At this time, we can use ‘other user requests’ to add possible user statements under this branch and give corresponding responses. If the user needs to exit, it can also be indicated in this section. If necessary, it is also supported to continue this branch outside the form.</p><h3 id="confirm"> <a href="#confirm" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="confirm"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Confirm</h3><p>When the form is filled without failure, all variables are filled out, and the form pops up normally, all processes behind this node will be executed. Usually, the node needs to confirm all the variables previously, or it can be directly submitted to the external api through the system reply.</p><hr><footer><p><a href="#top" id="back-to-top">Back to top</a></p><p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Copyright &copy; 2022 <a href="https://www.promptai.cn">Prompt AI</a> Powered By <a href="https://www.zervice.cn">Zervice</a></p><div class="d-flex mt-2"></div></footer></div></div></div>
