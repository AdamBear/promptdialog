# Welcome to Prompt AI
{: .no_toc .header }

We present PromptDialog, an integrated development (IDE) and operation environment (DevOps) to enable rapid prototyping and delivery of conversational assistants, aka,chatbots. 

PromptDialog supports RASA and GPT4, together with a design/testing/deployment environment (an alternative of RASA-X and RASA-Pro).  With PromptDialog, we aim to bring you an AI experience with the latest LLM technology and significant reduction (90%) of development cost.
When you are using RASA Open Source, you might be disappointed by the lack of Large Language Modelsâ€™ support (LLMs) and the missing of RASA-X that provides low code user interface for data annotation and model training.  When you are using GPT4, you might be concerned on how to embed your own business logic.  This is exactly what we experienced when building chatbots for financial institutes and car manufacturers.   PromptDialog solves both problems by enabling GPT4 in RASA Open Source.    And most important, it is free!  Here are a few highlights:
* Turn enterprise documents of various forms (FAQ, CSV, PDF, Doc, Text, HTML) into one knowledge base powered by GPT ([talk2bits.com](https://talk2bits.com)).  It can be easily integrated with your RASA code. 
* Business logic visualization.  The conversational flow is drawn explicitly, not as vague as annotated conversations or python programs any more.  It can be displayed and shared with your team members.
* All-in-one DevOps: Design, develop and operate conversations, on premises or cloud, in one platform.
* Zero shot intent classification and entity recognition, less or even no annotation required (coming soon).

Prof. Xifeng Yan has a track record of building [knowledge grounded conversational AI engines](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~xyan/knowledgebase.html).  His teams have participated in building various kinds of conversational bots including three Amazon Alexa Chatbot Challenges in 2022-2023, [TaskBot](https://www.amazon.science/academic-engagements/amazon-launches-new-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge), [SimBot](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge), and [Socialbot](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/socialbot-grand-challenge/2022). All of his teams entered the final event with the highest rate given by Amazon Alexa users.
