# Reset Slot Value
{: .no_toc .header }

In the Dialog flow, in addition to judging the slot value, we also support setting the slot value to a specified value.

## Set the Slot value to the custom value

Let's take buying pizza as an example, assuming there are three sizes: Small, Medium, and Large, corresponding to 10 inches, 12 inches, and 14 inches, respectively.

Pizzas of different sizes can be selected according to needs, and finally the size selected by the user is output. User selected size will be converted to inches.

`Small`:
- Click `Reset Slot Value`
- Select `Slot Name` with `area`
- Set `Slot Value` to `10 inches`
