In order to build and run a dialog flow in a local machine, there are four steps: design a dialog flow, create the local running environment (you only need to do it once), download the generated code from your design, and run. 

## Step One - Create a Dialog flow
Create your first Dialog flow via PromptDialog

## Step Two - Create the local environment
You can build a local running environment with one line of command. For details, please check [local environement setup](/docs/local_running_env) and check [install question] (/docs/common_questions/install_questions) if you have any question.

## Step Three - Download RASA code
All Dialog flows and fAQs can be downloaded as RASA code for free to build your chatbot in any RASA environment (RASA 3.2).

## Step Four - Train and run
After downloading the RASA code, you can train your model in your local running environment, and chat with your new model.
