Sometimes we delete a node or multiple nodes by mistake.  Undo/Redo will help us go back to the previous step.  Suppose we have the following conversation flow.

![001-redo_undo](/assets/images/tutorial/redo_undo/01-redo_undo.png)

We delete the last bot response node as shown in the figure. 

![02-redo_undo](/assets/images/tutorial/redo_undo/02-redo_undo.png)

We click `undo` to restore the deleted bot node.

![03-redo_undo](/assets/images/tutorial/redo_undo/03-redo_undo.png)

We click `Redo` to delete the recovered bot node again.
