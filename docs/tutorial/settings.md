## Configure the delay time of bot reply

The bot reply node can set the reply delay time. When the robot replies, it will delay the corresponding set time to reply to the message. As shown in the figure, we set the robot to reply with a 1s delay

When the user enters the intention to hit the bot reply with the set delay time, the bot will reply after the reset delay time. As shown in the figureï¼š

## Configure bot reply conditions

When the bot reply condition is set, it will go through the blocked branches according to whether the value of the corresponding variable is extracted. When there are multiple conditions, they need to be met at the same time
As shown in the figure, we can continue the following selection when the `city` is not empty

After setting the reset variable value, the value of the variable will be reset to the set value, and the value extracted by the subsequent node from the variable is the set value. The setting method is shown in the figure
