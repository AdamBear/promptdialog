## Unstructured content
If you have unstructred content available in files like CSV, Word Doc, PDF, Text, HTML etc.,  you can upload these files to [talk2bits.com], which provides service to directly answer your question using ChatGPT/GPT4.  PromptDialog has integrated this function. Please check the knowledgebase section [link here]. 

## Training options
When you train your model, we provide three training options (please give the interface picture and the location of that interface):
- RASA native:  It uses RASAâ€™s own routine to train FAQ classifier.  In this case, a user is required to give a few similar questions.
- ChatGPT/GPT4: It employes ChatGPT/GPT4 to do querestion comparison and retrieve answer.  This is an approach we recommend as the designer need not provide many similar questions.  This needs to be done through [talk2bits.com]. Please check the knowledgebase section [link here]. 
- Customized BERT model: It can be trained and deployed locally to best protect privacy and has performnace between RASA FAQ and ChatGPT. For this option, please contact us [info@promptai.us].
