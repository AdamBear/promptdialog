Our system architecture provides users with a flexible and efficient editing and execution environment to meet their personalized needs. On our platform, you can enjoy the convenience of cloud-based editing while running the model in your own environment, ensuring data security and privacy.

In our system architecture, we place the editing environment in the cloud. This means you can access the editing interface anytime, anywhere, using any device, without the need for complex software installation. As long as you have an internet connection, you can easily edit and manage your chatbot.


Our editing environment offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, enabling you to effortlessly design and configure your own FAQ and multi-turn conversations. You can utilize a range of tools and features to define conversation flows, set response logic, manage entities and intents, and more. Whether you're developing new dialogue flows or optimizing existing chatbots, our editing environment caters to your needs.

At the same time, our system architecture emphasizes the protection of user data security and privacy. Your data is stored in secure cloud servers and is subject to strict encryption and access controls. We employ state-of-the-art security technologies and measures to ensure the ongoing protection of your data during transmission and storage processes.

Upon completion of editing, our system allows you to deploy the model to run in your own environment. This provides you with greater flexibility and control, enabling customization and integration of the chatbot with your existing systems. You can run the model in a local environment, achieving faster response times and maintaining data privacy.

Whether editing in the cloud or running the model in your local environment, our system architecture is dedicated to providing users with a convenient, secure, and flexible experience. You have the freedom to choose the working method that suits you best, and perform editing and deployment according to your needs. We understand the importance of data security and privacy and have implemented a range of measures to protect your information.

Under our system architecture, you can focus on creating and optimizing the conversational experience without worrying about infrastructure and technical details.
