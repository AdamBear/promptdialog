## What is Fallback?

Fallback PromptDialog refers to a backup plan used when the system encounters inputs it cannot understand or process. It helps the system deal with the following situations:

- When users ask unrelated questions (Dialog flows & Faq not include the input), the system responds with something like "I don't know."
- If the user's input is unclear or ambiguous, the system asks for more specific information.
- When the system is uncertain about a response, it may indicate its uncertainty.
- In the case of technical issues or errors, the system explains the problem to the user and may offer solutions.
