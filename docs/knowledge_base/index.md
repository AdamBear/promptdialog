There are two kinds of knowledge base in PromptDialog: [FAQ](https://doc.promptai.us/docs/tutorial/faq/) and Unstructured Content storted in text, word, pdf, html, etc.. For FAQ, please refer to our tutorial of [FAQ](https://doc.promptai.us/docs/tutorial/faq/). For unstructured content, PromptDialog integrates the service provided by [talk2bits.com](talk2bits.com) where a user can upload their documents and get an API to query these documents for question answering.
