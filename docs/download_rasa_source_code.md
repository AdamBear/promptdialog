When developers need to debug and verify the designed flows, they can use the **Download Rasa Files** function to download the generated RASA code in their local running environment and test the bot locally.  If you prefer testing/running the chatbot on the cloud without setting up local environment, please contact us [info@promptai.us](info@promptai.us).  We have a complete cloud solution. 

## Rasa file download

Click **Download RASA File** at the top right corner.  The download box will pop up with the following options:

* Current download, download the current dialog flow
* Combined download, free check multiple dialog flows under the current project
* Download all, check all dialog flow diagrams under the current project

- When the current project has a flow diagram containing error nodes, it will be classified into **Unavailable Modules** in the pop-up box. Click the mouse on the flow diagram to see the number of error messages. The link behind the point flow diagram can quickly jump to the corresponding flow diagram for modification.
